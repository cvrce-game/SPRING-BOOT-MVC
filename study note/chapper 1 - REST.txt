Creating a Hello World Service
-------------------------------

1.@Controller
-----------
We need to annotatated a class with @Controller annotation, so that spring will get to the that this will be my
controller which will controll my HTTP request.

@RestController : It will indicate the spring to handle rest request.


2.Define a method with return type and add @RequestMapping on top of the method.
@RequestMapping : Mapp the request like GET,POST,DELETE ect. this annotation is used.
				  
				  We need to mention the Request type in method attribute.
				  eg. method=RequestMethod.GET
				  
				  We need to mapp the URI in path attribute
				  eg. path="/hello"
				  
				  @RequestMapping(method=RequestMethod.GET, path="/hello")
				  
Example

@RestController
public class HelloWorldController {

	//GET
	//URI : "/hello"
	//method : helloWorld
	@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, path = "/hello")
	public String helloWorld() {
		
		return "Hi";
		
	}
}

3. Instead of @RequestMapping, we can use @GetMapping and remove method type

@RestController
public class HelloWorldController {

	//GET
	//URI : "/hello"
	//method : helloWorld
	@GetMapping(path = "/hello")
	public String helloWorld() {
		
		return "Hi";
		
	}
}

4.Like @GetMapping, we can use @PutMapping and @DeleteMapping for put and delete request
