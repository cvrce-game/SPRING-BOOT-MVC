Filtering Json from Response
----------------------------

-> If there are 3 fields in your pojo, but you dont want to send 2nd and 3rd properties in the response. then we need to follow Filtering concept.

@JsonIgonre
-----------
If we will add this annonation on top of the property  then it will be ignored in the JSON.

Ex. 

@JsonIgonre
private String password.

@@JsonIgnoreProperties(value = {name,password})
----------------------------------------
This annonation is added on top of the Class to indicate the name of the properties to ignored from the Response JSON.

Ex.
@@JsonIgnoreProperties(value={"name","password"})
Public Class UserDto{

}

Dynamic Filtering
